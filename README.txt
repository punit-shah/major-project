The application source can be found in the `src` directory.
The built application can be found in the `build` directory.

## Dependencies

You will need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your computer.
You can download them from:
https://nodejs.org/en/
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/

To install the project dependencies, navigate to this directory from the command line, and run:
```
yarn install
```

To start the development server, run:
```
yarn start
```
This will build the application to the `build` directory using Webpack and serve the content.
When your terminal says `webpack: Compiled successfully.`, the application has finished building.
Visit `http://localhost:8080` from your browser to view the application.
